TODOs:

Models and forms:
    Locations:
        - gym rating - Default: none -> empty star
    Profiles:
        - find how to increment the years of xp and age every year
        - validate the years of xp are not exceeding the age of the trainer - 18
        - think of a booking a meeting mechanism
        - Dashboard Stats for the year. Num of workouts,goals achieved, etc.
        - trainee view for trainers - full list of goals, workouts, traineeprofile info
        weight, height, etc
    Sport App:
        - rating as in the gyms
        - inline formsets to the workouts so x-number of exercises could be added
        - also fix the edit workout page as it is still the general update cbv
        - Instead of a btn maybe make a heart on the thumbnail that the user
        can click on for fave exercises and an open book for articles and reading list
        - consider a list with categories of goals depending on level:
        beginner goals: 10 pull ups; run 5km
        advanced: learn to handstand; run 20km marathon
        - the workout model should sum all kg lifted, distance ran, etc in a method
        - workout - calendar view
Prime membership:
    - filter by prime,
    - only prime can write articles.
    - Add call-to action for subscribing to prime.

Template files:
- login.html:
    - when logged in, redirect to the page that the visitor tried to access before

Admin dashboard that shows the count of trainees with favourite sports,
exercises, articles, etc.
Also think of what other metrics the business might need.

Styling:
- related items on the right side of the view (Article list on the left;
    small menu with gyms/trainers on the right)
- forms in modal windows? hmmmm
- align the dashboard-sections so there is enough space between the nav
and the profile card. Center the content
Load the pages with animation

Error Handling and Unit Testing

run 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'

create 2 users and 2 trainer default profiles
python manage.py loaddata trainer_profile_data

Bugs:
- profile requirements mixins.
- In exercises and Workouts list show only content that is created by the
    user except for the base content.
- phone to be changed as char instead of number input and put num validator.
If you enter a number starting with 0 it is not a valid number, hence error.
- users can change other people's profiles - mixin that allows only the owner to access the page.
- Edit profile-the metrics are showing under the field (KG, CM). Fix them so they
are next to the label in ().
- disable the username field from edit profile.
- the update and back to profile buttons don't work.
- the unsubscribe form works weird. Either change the copy so it prompts the user to uncheck
the box for prime or change the button so it deactivates the prime when checked.

Trainer dashboard:
- trainees who've had contract with the trainer can leave comments and rate the coach
Rating + comment form
- inbox

System:
- System will send messages for:
    - new, expiring and cancelled contracts
    - new messages
    - new comments/ratings
    - new, upcoming or cancelled bookings
    - etc
