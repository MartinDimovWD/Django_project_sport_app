TODOs:

load the pages with animation

Models and forms:
    Locations:
        - gym rating - Default: none -> empty star
    Profiles:
        - find how to increment the years of xp and age every year
        - validate the years of xp are not exceeding the age of the trainer - 18
        - think of a hiring mechanism
        - Add a section in the dashboard with favourite exercises - kilograms
            lifted/kilometers ran /etc
        - Dashboard Stats for the year. Num of workouts,goals achieved, etc.
        - Accordion Menu - Goals, Workouts, Stats
    Sport App:
        - rating as in the gyms
        - inline formsets to the workouts so x-number of exercises could be added
        - also fix the edit workout page as it is still the general update cbv
        - add to fav mechanism (exercises and articles). Instead of a btn
        maybe make a heart on the thumbnail that the user can click on for fave exercises
        and an open book for articles and reading list
        - goal description is added in the panel. also add it to the dashboard
        - consider a list with categories of goals depending on level:
        beginner goals: 10 pull ups; run 5km
        advanced: learn to handstand; run 20km marathon
Prime membership:
    - filter by prime,
    - only prime can write articles.
    - Add call-to action for subscribing to prime.

Template files:
- login.html:
    - when logged in, redirect to the page that the visitor tried to access before

Admin dashboard that shows the count of trainees with favourite sports,
exercises, articles, etc.

Styling:
- related items on the right side of the view (Article list on the left;
    small menu with gyms/trainers on the right)
- forms in modal windows? hmmmm

run 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'

create 2 users and 2 trainer default profiles
python manage.py loaddata trainer_profile_data

Bugs:
- profile requirements mixins.
- In exercises and Workouts list show only content that is created by the
    user except for the base content.
- phone to be changed as char instead of number input and put num validator.
If you enter a number starting with 0 it is not a valid number, hence error.
- users can change other people's profiles - mixin that allows only the owner to access the page.
- the goals field in the complete trainee profile shows all goals.
I can maybe disable the field in that view so the goals are only managed through the
goal management panel. Also the metrics are showing under the field. Fix them
so they are next to the label in ().
- disable the username field from edit profile.
- the update and back to profile buttons don't work.
