TODOs:

Models and forms:
    Profiles:
        - find how to increment the years of xp and age every year
        - validate the years of xp are not exceeding the age of the trainer - 18
        - think of a booking a meeting mechanism
        - Dashboard Stats for the year. Num of workouts,goals achieved, etc.
        - 'Workout Buddies' - users can make friends and chat with each other.
        - Users can add their social media in their profiles.
        - Google calendar - ask the clients to put their google calendar link so it is displayed in the schedule

    Sport App:
        - inline formsets to the workouts so x-number of exercises could be added
        - also fix the edit workout page as it is still the general update cbv
        - Instead of a btn maybe make a heart on the thumbnail that the user can click on for fave exercises and an open book for articles and reading list
        - consider a list with categories of goals depending on level:
            beginner goals: 10 pull ups; run 5km
            advanced: learn to handstand; run 20km marathon
        - the workout model should sum all kg lifted, distance ran, etc in a method
        - workout - calendar view
        - figure out how to reuse the get_avg_rating function. Either as an abstract function or make it a method in the classes.
        - filter gyms by open now, location and sports
        - add the articles list of each trainer in their trainer detail view

Prime membership:
    - filter by prime
    - Add call-to action for subscribing to prime.

Admin dashboard that shows the count of trainees with favourite sports, exercises, articles, etc.
Also think of what other metrics the business might need.

Styling:
- related items on the right side of the view (Article list on the left; small menu with gyms/trainers on the right)
- Still not sure how to place the rating form and comments so all looks nice and tidy
- Load the pages with animation
- think of a better looking footer (e.g. make it visible only when scrolled to the bottom of the page.
- make the article detail page look better.

Error Handling and Unit Testing

run 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'

create 2 users and 2 trainer default profiles
python manage.py loaddata trainer_profile_data

Bugs:
- profile requirements mixins.
- phone to be changed as char instead of number input and put num validator. If you enter a number starting with 0 it is not a valid number, hence error.
- users can change other people's profiles - mixin that allows only the owner to access the page.
- fix the update profile button and views
- the unsubscribe form works weird. Either change the copy so it prompts the user to uncheck the box for prime or change the button so it deactivates the prime when checked.

Trainer dashboard:
- inbox

System:
- System will send messages for:
    - new, expiring and cancelled contracts
    - new messages
    - new comments/ratings
    - new, upcoming or cancelled bookings
    - etc
